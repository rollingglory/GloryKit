<p>GloryKit starts your project off with a great preparation and <i>almost</i> everything you need to start developing with ease ðŸ’– and a peace of mind ðŸ˜Œ.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Currently GloryKit can only be installed using Carthage or manual submoduling.
<b>Please refer to <i>release status</i> for release availability. Don't use incubation/beta version without knowing and accepting possible bugs or issues.</b></p>

<b>Carthage</b>:
<pre>
github "https://github.com/rollingglory/GloryKit" == 1.0
</pre>

<p>New to Carthage? You can follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage">here</a> to use Carthage and add frameworks to project.</p>

<b>Submodule</b>:

<p>Simply clone or download this project and add manually to your project directory.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>For basic usage you can import GloryKit and other corresponding framework, as GloryKit doesn't automatically include specific framework in usage of its methods.</p>

<pre>
import GloryKit

class MyClass: GloryController {
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    Glory().initiate()
  }
}
</pre>

<p>You can directly use GloryKit features, extensions, public helper and many more.
For advanced class reference, though, you can read them all <a href="https://rollingglory.com/glorykit/docs.html">here</a>.</p>
