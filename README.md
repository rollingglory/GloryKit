>GloryKit starts your project off with a great preparation and _almost_ everything you need to start developing with ease ‚ù§Ô∏è and a peace of mind üòå.

## Installation

Currently GloryKit can only be installed using Carthage or manual submoduling.

**Carthage**:
```bash
github "https://github.com/rollingglory/GloryKit" == 1.0
```
New to Carthage? You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) to use Carthage and add frameworks to project.

**Submodule**:

Simply clone or download this project and add manually to your project directory.

## Usage

For basic usage you can import GloryKit and other corresponding framework, as GloryKit doesn't automatically include specific framework in usage of its methods.

```swift
import GloryKit

class MyClass: GloryController {
override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

Glory().initiate()
}
}
```

You can directly use GloryKit features, extensions, public helper and many more.
For advanced class reference, though, you can read them all [here](https://rollingglory.com/glorykit/docs.html).
